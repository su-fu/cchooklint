`cchooklint` is a diagnostic CLI that statically analyzes Claude Code's `.claude/settings.json` hooks configuration on Windows, looking for two specific, verified bugs:

1. **Typos in `Bash`/`PowerShell` matcher tool names** — these silently disable the hook. No error, no warning from Claude Code itself.
2. **Safety-guard-style hooks whose `matcher` only covers `Bash` or `PowerShell`, not both** — the hook silently fails to fire when the other tool is used (a "fail open" gap).

## Why this exists

On Windows, Claude Code can run shell commands through two different tools: the Bash tool (Git Bash) and the PowerShell tool. A hook's `matcher` filters by tool name, so a hook configured with `matcher: "Bash"` only fires when the Bash tool is used — if Claude uses PowerShell instead, the hook is silently skipped.

This is especially dangerous for safety-guard hooks (e.g. ones that block dangerous commands): whoever configured it may not realize that half of their safety net is silently disabled. Both bugs described above were reproduced and verified on a real Windows machine before this project started.

`cchooklint` is read-only: it never modifies your settings files and never triggers hooks to test them at runtime. It only checks the specific `Bash`/`PowerShell` gap described above — it is not a general-purpose tool-name checker.

For the coverage check, if a hook's `command` invokes a local script file (e.g. `python .claude/hooks/guard.py`), `cchooklint` also looks inside that script for the same danger signals, since the hook's actual logic often lives there rather than in the inline command string. If the script can't be found or read, it falls back to checking just the command string.

## Install

```sh
go install github.com/su-fu/cchooklint/cmd/cchooklint@latest
```

(Not yet published to a versioned release — build from source for now.)

## Usage

```sh
cchooklint
```

This scans, in order:

- `.claude/settings.json` (project)
- `.claude/settings.local.json` (project, local overrides)
- `~/.claude/settings.json` (user)

and prints a warning for every hook affected by either bug.

### Example

Given a `.claude/settings.json` with a typo'd matcher and a hook that only covers `Bash`:

```sh
$ cchooklint
[WARN] "Bahs" does not match any known tool name. Did you mean "Bash"?
[WARN] This hook only covers "Bash". It won't fire when the other tool is used. Consider changing it to "Bash|PowerShell".
```

For machine-readable output, use `--format=json`:

```json
{"version":1,"findings":[{"source_file":".claude/settings.json","event":"PreToolUse","severity":"WARN","code":"matcher_typo","args":["Bahs","Bash"]}]}
```

The JSON envelope is versioned and includes stable rule codes plus the raw
message arguments. `--lang` does not change JSON output.

### Language

Output language is selected in this order:

1. `--lang` flag (e.g. `cchooklint --lang=ja`)
2. `CCHOOKLINT_LANG` environment variable
3. `en` (default)

Supported: `en`, `ja`, `zh`. Unsupported values fall back to `en`.

### Exit codes

- `0` — no findings and no tool errors
- `1` — one or more hook findings were reported
- `2` — a settings discovery or loading error occurred
